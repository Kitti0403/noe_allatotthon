The goal of the project is to modernize the visual and structural aspects of the No√© Animal Shelter's website, which includes a responsive design, navigation improvements, and enhanced user experience. Additionally, we developed a pet food calculator that helps pet owners calculate the amount of food for dogs, cats, horses, and goats.
